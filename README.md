# Support-ticket-categorization-system

## Situation:

- The increasing volume of customer support tickets made it difficult to efficiently identify, prioritize, and resolve customer issues.
- It led to delayed responses, increased customer frustration, and a negative impact on customer satisfaction.
- The system could not automatically categorize tickets, which caused inconsistent identification of issues and inefficient use of resources.

## Task:

- Develop an advanced support ticket categorization system that will streamline the support process.
- The system should classify all incoming tickets accurately into predefined categories and subcategories.
- Develop automated tagging based on content in tickets to enable the easy filtering and routing of messages.
- Create a mechanism for prioritizing tickets based on both urgency and sentiment.
- Automate the generation of initial responses based on ticket category and sentiment.

## Action:

- Ran detailed research on best practices and existing methods related to support ticket categorization.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams (customer support, engineering, data science) to collect requirements and define system specifications.
- Designed and developed a machine learning model to accurately classify tickets based on text analysis techniques, for example, Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis.
- Built an easy-to-use interface for support agents to review and refine automated classifications.
- Developed a system to prioritize tickets based on urgency (for example, severity level, customer impact) and sentiment (negative, neutral, positive).
- Developed a knowledge base of pre-defined responses for common ticket categories and sentiments.
- Integrate the system with the existing customer support tools and workflows.

## Outcome:
- The response time to the support tickets improved dramatically up to 20%.
- Customer satisfaction scores increased by 5%.
- Agent productivity improved by 15% through automated tasks and streamlined workflows.
- Valuable insights into customer pain points and areas for product improvement were achieved.
- Developed a scalable and maintainable system that could adapt to the changing needs of customers.
